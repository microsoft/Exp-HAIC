        <p> In all stages of the study, you will work alongside an artificial intelligence (AI)
          diagnostic tool. This AI diagnostic tool tool uses machine learning models that have been trained on X-rays
          with condition labels generated by a pool of expert radiologists. </p>

      <h3> The AI diagnostic tool's predictions </h3>
      <p> The AI diagnostic tool produces probability predictions for each of the 33 listed conditions. These
        predictions consist of numeric scores between 0% and 100% that indicate the likelihood that the condition is
        present in the X-ray, according to the AI diagnostic tool.
        A value of 100% indicates that the condition is certainly present in the image, according to the tool. A value
        of 0%, instead, means that the tool predicts that the condition is certainly not present in the X-ray. The
        probability predictions generated by the AI tool may not be well calibrated. This means that, for example, among
        all the images for which the tool predicts that some condition is present with probability 80%, the condition
        might actually be present only 60% of the times. An example of a probability prediction generated by the tool is
        shown below.

      </div>
      <p>It is common to transform these probability predictions into binary predictions.
        Here, we have added icons containing red triangles in the navigation bar on the right next to the conditions for
        which tool's estimated probability is larger than or equal to 60%.
        For example, in the screenshot below the tool's estimated probability is above 60% for "Liver abnormality",
        whereas it is below 60% for "Spondylosis" and all other conditions. </p>

      <h3> When is the AI diagnosis revealed? </h3>
      For each case, you will first be asked to make a diagnosis without the help of the AI diagnostic tool.
      Once you have made your diagnosis, click the blue button in the top right corner of the interface.
      You will then be shown the tool's predictions and allowed to revise your diagnosis.
      {% endif %}
      Once you have completed your diagnosis, click the blue button in the top right corner to proceed to the following
      case.
      <div title='How to complete the task and proceed to the next case' class="imageWrapper"><img class="gif"

    <div class="row" style='padding-top:1cm;'>
      <p>
        At the end of the 20 tasks, you might be shown a short questionnaire. <br>You are now ready to make your
        diagnoses!
